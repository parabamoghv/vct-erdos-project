### Project Description

Valorant is a first-person tactical hero shooter video team game created by Riot Games. Throughout the year professional Valorant teams participate in various tournaments to claim the title of Valorant Champions. We want to create a model that predicts the results of 2023 Valorant championship matches using the regular season data. Also, we want to figure out which aspects of the game matter the most in such models.

## Getting started

To get started with this repository, we need to set up a reproducible environment. The tool we will use here is Poetry. In a new conda environment (we will use Python 3.10), install Poetry as

```
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

This will install the dependencies of the project into your virtual environment. Now we need to fetch the data from Kaggle. You will first need to get an API authentication token from your Kaggle account (**DO NOT COMMIT THIS TOKEN INTO THE REPO**). Follow https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication in order to create an API token and store the generated `kaggle.json` into the recommended location in your filesystem.

Once you have your API token in place, run

```
kaggle datasets download -d ryanluong1/valorant-champion-tour-2021-2023-data -p data/
unzip data/valorant-champion-tour-2021-2023-data.zip -d data/
rm data/valorant-champion-tour-2021-2023-data.zip
```

Now you have the VCT dataset ready to go!

## Data processing

We have a vast collection of data from professional tournaments played over the years 2021 to 2023. The data includes results, economy data, individual player and team statistics, and team compositions; at the levels of both individual rounds and an entire game (which usually lasts 13 to 24 rounds). We collected this data from Kaggle.com.

For this project, we only used tournaments held in 2023.  The data was spread over various files with varying amounts of overlapping and missing data relative to each other.  We put substantial effort into unifying the data into a single dataframe while preserving key features. We indexed our data by games, with around 160 features per game after feature engineering. 

### Feature engineering

Main data files we used are: `maps_scores.csv, overview.csv, players_stats.csv, eco_rounds.csv, kills.csv, scores.csv`.  Since there is no data giving outcomes of each game, we used `maps_scores.csv` to extract each game outcome and combine it with other data.  For example, `players_stats.csv` has data about individual players' performance on each match, but it doesn't have match outcomes.

Similarly, `eco_rounds.csv` and `kills.csv` have no match outcomes, so we needed to combined them with `maps_scores.csv` and `scores.csv` in order to

1. study how individual rounds are related to overall match outcomes and
2. define eco_rating, special_kills_rating with economy, special kills per rounds and match outcomes.

You can find more details in the following notebooks.

- vct_2023_eco_rating_using_prob.ipynb
- vct_2023_kills_vs_scores.ipynb
- vct_2023_special_kills_rating.ipynb

After manufacturing our own ratings, *eco_rating* and *special_kills_rating*, we need to save them for use in another notebook.
Run `"vct_2023_eco_rating_using_prob.ipynb"` and `"vct_2023_special_kills_rating.ipynb"`.  It will create three csv files in "../data/vct_2023/":

- eco_ratings.csv
- special_kills_non_finals_rounds.csv
- special_kills_non_finals.csv

*<u>You have to run those two notebooks before you run `"vct_2023_final_data_processing.ipynb"`.</u>*


Our final step, to create train and test data, is in `"vct_2023_final_data_processing.ipynb"`.  In this notebook, first we make interaction terms of player's ratings and roles.  For example, if a player played "Controller" and had rating 1.2, its "Cont_rating" feature value is 1.2.  This process increases the total number of features immensely.  However, we performed this process to capture the potential impact of agent picks.

Then we combine *eco_rating* and *special_kills_rating* with *players rating/stat*.  Next, we split our data into two sets: training data, consisting of all tournaments before "Valorant Champions 2023", and test data, representing the "Valorant Champions 2023" tournament.  Then we take the average of individual player's ratings in train data, and assign it as a predictor of test data, instead of using true value in test data.

Runing `"vct_2023_final_data_processing.ipynb"` creates train data and test data in "../data/vct_2023/processed_data/" which will be used in our model training.


## Feature and model selection and hyperparameter tuning

### Feature selection

By performing feature engineering, we have around 160 many features.  We want to now narrow down what features are most important.

We used ".feature_importances_" of XGBClassifier to select the most important features.  Interestingly, we can see some of our engineered ratings, most importantly, eco_rating has really high importance than others.

Afterward, we trained
- LogisticRegression
- KNeighborsClassifier
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier
- XGBClassifier

on

- important features, including engineered ones, XGBClassifier found
- non-engineered features
- eco_ratings and non-engineered features.

In most cases, XGBClassifier performed the best and it gave accuracy around 67% on the test set.

### Hyperparameter tuning

We could use our engineered features and RandomForest, which showed higher performance than XGBClassifier.  However, this will require longer training time and more memory.  Moreover, XGB's performance on all features and its performance on eco_rating and non-engineered features showed similar results.  Hence, we decided to train XGBClassifier on eco_rating and non-engineered features.

With some hyperparameter tuning, we could improve the accuracy up to 69-70%.

You can find details about feature and model selection and hyperparameter tuning in `"vct_2023_model_feature_selection.ipynb"`.
## Future direction

In our analysis we realized that in a match certain rounds matter more than others. Also, round win/loss momentum has a role in the match result. We would like to incorporate this in our model.
